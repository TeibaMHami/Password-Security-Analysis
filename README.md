# Password Security Analysis
A data-driven exploration of password behavior and strength using real-world leaked datasets. This project dives into how passwords are created, reused, and how vulnerable they are to cracking techniques.
# Project Overview
Passwords remain one of the weakest links in security. This analysis focuses on understanding common patterns, estimating strength, and evaluating the risks that arise from predictable password habits.

Using curated subsets of public datasets, this project covers:

- Strength estimation (entropy, brute-force crack time, ..etc)
- Reuse and repetition trends
- Length distribution and averages
- Common character combinations and leetspeaks pattern
- Most common passwords across countries and industries
# Datasets
- **RockYou Sample**: 1 million passwords randomly selected for analysis  
- **Top Country Passwords**: Top 200 most common passwords by country in 2021 (~9,800 total records)  
- **Industry Passwords**: Top 20 weak passwords in various industries (~20 total records)
# Tools
-**Python**: For data curation, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis  
- **Tableau**: For creating dashboards and visualizations
